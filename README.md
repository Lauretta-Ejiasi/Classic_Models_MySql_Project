# Classic_Models_MySql_Project
This project demonstrates my ability to execute querries on MySql using Classic Models database.

The Classic Models database is a sample database that represents a fictional company selling scale model cars. It is commonly used for learning and practicing SQL queries. The database consists of several tables, including 'Customers', 'Orders', 'Products', 'Employees', 'Payments', and more. Each table contains relevant information about customers, orders, products, employees, and payments. The Classic Models database allows to perform various SQL operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data to understand different aspects of database management and data manipulation.

Below is a summary of the MySQL queries used in this project:
The MySQL querries in the attached script performs various operations on the Classic Models database. 
The queries retrieve data from tables such as 'Employees', 'Products', 'Orders', 'Customers', and 'Payments'. Some of the operations includes selecting data based on specific criteria, counting the number of distinct values, calculating the average, sum, and minimum values, and grouping data by specific columns. 
In addition, the queries also involves joining tables using inner join to retrieve data from multiple tables based on specified conditions. They includes filtering data using WHERE clauses to narrow down the results based on specific criteria. 
Some queries involve sorting the results in ascending or descending order using ORDER BY clause. The queries cover a wide range of operations such as retrieving specific rows, counting rows, performing calculations, and grouping data. They provide a comprehensive overview of the different ways data can be queried and manipulated in the Classic Models database.
